# A mathematical model based on climate change was formulated as a part of Group Project. The model attempts to answer the following questions:
 1. Can we formulate a mathematical model that establishes the relationship between global temperature, seasonal precipitation and forest coverage?
 2. What is the impact of rising rainfall trends on declining forest areas and global temperature?
 3. How does global temperature change with forest area?
 4. Is the model capable of predicting future climate changes?
